Raw gene expression data from these high-throughput technologies must be normalized to remove technical variation so that meaningful biological comparisons can be made. Data normalization is a crucial step in the gene expression analysis as it ensures the validity of its downstream analyses. Normalization is the process of scaling individual samples to have unit norm. In basic terms, you need to normalize data when the algorithm predicts based on the weighted relationships formed between data points. The goal of normalization is to change the values of numeric columns in the dataset to a common scale, without distorting differences in the ranges of values.</p>

Missing data presents various problems. First, the absence of data reduces statistical power, which refers to the probability that the test will reject the null hypothesis when it is false. Second, the lost data can cause bias in the estimation of parameters. Third, it can reduce the representativeness of the samples. Fourth, it may complicate the analysis of the study.</p>
              <p class="det-p-manual">One of the simplest methods to reduce the impact of missing values is to drop the complete sample including the missing values so that it won’t skew the results. However, when the sample size is small, this might not be a good approach. Instead of dropping the whole sample, you can replace the missing value with the average of present values which will be a fair indicator of the missing values.</p>

        <p class="det-p-manual">Microarray studies often aim to identify genes that are differentially regulated across different classes of samples; examples are: finding the genes affected by treatment or finding marker genes that discriminate diseased from healthy subjects. Since the data set contains a column named ‘class’ with binary values, we can identify differentially expressed genes across those two samples by performing statistical tests.</p>

      <div class="row">
        <p class="det-p-head"><b>Comparing two conditions</b></p>
        <p class="det-p-manual">A simple microarray experiment may be carried out to detect the differences in expression between two conditions. Each condition may be represented by one or more RNA samples. Using two-color cDNA microarrays, samples can be compared directly on the same microarray or indirectly by hybridizing each sample with a common reference sample. The null hypothesis being tested is that there is no difference in expression between the conditions; when conditions are compared directly, this implies that the true ratio between the expression of each gene in the two samples should be one. When samples are compared indirectly, the ratios between the test sample and the reference sample should not differ between the two conditions.</p>

      <div class="row">
        <p class="det-p-head"><b>'Fold' change</b></p>
        <p class="det-p-manual">The simplest method for identifying differentially expressed genes is to evaluate the log-ratio between two conditions (or the average of ratios when there are replicates) and consider all genes that differ by more than an arbitrary cut-off value to be differentially expressed. For example, if the cut-off value is chosen is a two-fold difference, genes are taken to be differentially expressed if the expression under one condition is over two-fold greater or less than that under the other condition.</p>

        <p class="det-p-head"><b>P-Value</b></p>
        <p class="det-p-manual">In statistics, the p-value is the probability of obtaining results as extreme as the observed results of a statistical hypothesis test, assuming that the null hypothesis is correct. The p-value is used as an alternative to rejection points to provide the smallest level of significance at which the null hypothesis would be rejected. A smaller p-value means that there is stronger evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis. P-value is calculated through the t-test in GeNet.</p>

        <p class="det-p-head"><b>The t-test</b></p>
        <p class="det-p-manual">The t-test is a simple, statistically based method for detecting differentially expressed genes. In replicated experiments, the error variance can be estimated for each gene from the log ratios, and a standard t-test can be conducted for each gene; the resulting t statistic can be used to determine which genes are significantly differentially expressed.</p>

It is a scatter-plot of the negative log10-transformed p-values from the t-test against the log2 fold change. Genes with statistically significant differential expression according to the gene-specific t-test will lie above a horizontal threshold line.

By observing this graph, you can get an idea of the number of genes showing the highest scores. You can see that after the bending point of the graph, the variation of scores is not changing much. That implies that those genes do not have a high impact on the target variable. To minimize the number of features, you can only select the number of genes appearing before the bending point of the graph.</p>

The problem with getting a higher number of correlated genes is that they might cause redundancy. Having redundant data in the final result may not provide novel information. Therefore, GeNet built its framework to identify the genes that are not redundant and provide the highest accuracy at the same time.</p>

        <p class="det-p-manual">A correlation matrix is a table showing correlation coefficients between sets of variables. Each random variable (Xi) in the table is correlated with each of the other values in the table (Xj). This allows you to see which pairs have the highest correlation. The color code bar at the right corner of the correlation plots shows how the color variation can be interpreted through the plot. The highest correlation occurs between the same two pairs of genes and corresponds to a correlation coefficient of 1. It is denoted by dark green while the lowest correlation coefficients are represented by dark red. If there’s a dark red unit in the plot, that means that those two particular genes are less correlated.</p>

It is a graphical plot that illustrates the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied. A ROC curve is constructed by plotting the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR). The true positive rate is the proportion of observations that were correctly predicted to be positive out of all positive observations (TP/(TP + FN)). Similarly, the false positive rate is the proportion of observations that are incorrectly predicted to be positive out of all negative observations (FP/(TN + FP)). The ROC curve shows the trade-off between sensitivity (or TPR) and specificity (1 – FPR). Classifiers that give curves closer to the top-left corner indicate better performance. The closer the curve comes to the 45-degree diagonal of the ROC space, the less accurate the test.</p>
